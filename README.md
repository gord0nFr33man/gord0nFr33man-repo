Working on a MySQL-database (8.0.20) using Python 3.9.7 in Spyder IDE 5.1.5 that at some point 
will be able to store measuring data provided by a MPU9255 sensor chip unit mounted on a RC-Car.


Future plans:
- feeding the tables with a predefined static set of data, using MySQL-statements in Spyder IDE.
- showing the raw content of the tables in Spyder's console
- adding a time stamp to the predefined set of data that will be injected into the tables
- feeding the tables with pseudorandomly generated data, using import random.
- feeding the tables with these pseudorandomly generated data within a update frequency of 100ms.
